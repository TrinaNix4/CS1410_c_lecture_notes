# C++ Basics

# About C++

- Compiled language
- Came from the C language
- Object oriented language

# C++ is compiled 

- Take code and run it through a compiler
- Compiler creates object code 
- with that object code you create the executable program
- When ready to use your program, you use the executable to send out and this produces your output

- Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language
- Take the source code. 
- Put it through an interpreter
- get your output

# output 

Code: 

```
int num = 10;					
cout << “Just Text”; 		
cout << “Text Line” << endl; 	
cout << num << endl; 			
```

Output:

Just TextText Line
10
Text: 10
